# Four-Language-that-can-kill-themselves

4 files, each with a different language. Each file will call the next file, and then commit die. Like this:

```
**main.cpp**
run main.py
kill itself

**main.py**
run main.rb
kill itself

etc.
```

Basically how this works is each file calls 2 shell commands, one to run the next file, and one to commit toaster bath. The bash command to commit skydiving without a parachute is `rm FILE_NAME` .

I also added brief comments on how the shell commands work in each language so you might learn something.
